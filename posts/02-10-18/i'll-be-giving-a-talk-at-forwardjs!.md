# I'll be Giving A Talk At ForwardJS!

I'll be talking at [ForwardJS](https://forwardjs.com/schedule#) this Tuesday the 13th! I'll be giving my talk "Taming the Hydra: Managing Monorepos with Lerna," and it hopefully won't end in a garbage fire. That's actually all I have for now, expect some post like "I gave a talk and no one died due to my terrible oration" in the near future.
