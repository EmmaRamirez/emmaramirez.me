# Projects and Writing in the Works

> Note: This could use a better title

Hi, I write and also I code. Sometimes, I am writing and coding, and it's a creative maelstrom, where good ideas get sucked into a vortex, never to appear again; the void consumes more and more manifestations of my thoughts, leaving nothing but a couple words, a couple letters, scaters of syntax.

tl;dr check out some things I'm working on:

> [Nuzlocke Generator](https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/nuzlocke-generator)

Still working hard on this project, if you have any interest in PokÃ©mon and nuzlocking, please check it out! I've been working on integrating downloading images, theme + component customization, and supporting more variations in rulesets.

> [Rust & Webassembly Talk](https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/rust-and-webassembly-talk)

This is the repo for the [talk I gave at BoulderJS](https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-JS/events/xmkdvmyxlbtb/). I'll just copypaste my abstract to give you an idea of the rundown:

Want to create powerful, high-performance web apps? Stuck at a bottleneck? Then this talk is for you!

Instead of a regular performance talk, we'll focus here on abstracting key parts of your web app into Webassembly. By compiling Rust, a memory and thread-safe language, into Webassembly code, we can swap out bits of Javascript for a faster codebase. We'll explore use cases and examples, with a focus on real-world problems that we can theoretically solve with wasm and Rust!

I'm working on polishing the repo so that the examples can be reused better, so check it out!

> [tslint-emma](https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/tslint-emma)

Okay, this is a bad name for repo, but here you can see me flounder around as I try to extend TSLint for some custom but kind of trivial rules.

> [dom-to-image](https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/dom-to-image)

This is a typescript rewrite of dom-to-image that improves performance, works with retina images, and includes bugfixes for Chrome & Firefox.
