# Projects and Writing in the Works

> Note: This could use a better title

Hi, I write and also I code. Sometimes, I am writing and coding, and it's a creative maelstrom, where good ideas get sucked into a vortex, never to appear again; the void consumes more and more manifestations of my thoughts, leaving nothing but a couple words, a couple letters, scaters of syntax.
