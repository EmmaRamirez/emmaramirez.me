<p>The more I worked, the less I coded. Okay, so perhaps that’s not entirely true&mdash;I still <em>write</em> code, but the code we write for work and the code we write as a result of passion are often very different, kind of like an abstract expressionist being asked to draw figurative paintings by the government versus splattering paint in their free time. It’s an ironic trap, since our love and pursuit of this hobby is what leads us to coding for work in the first place. And we work for food, so it isn’t stopping any time soon.</p>
<p>I can’t really talk about time management in depth since that’s something I suck at (don’t take that too seriously, future employers&mdash;thanks!), but I can talk about managing your own code.</p>
<h2 id="1-keep-work-pleasure-computers-separate">1. Keep Work &amp; Pleasure Computers Separate</h2>
<p>If you have explicit guidelines at work between what computers you use for work and fun, then great for you! This section doesn’t really apply. But for me, since I work from home, I have a lot of leeway in using my laptop. I think, as a result, it’s very important to have two separate machines because it helps emphasize the separation between the two. This is especially worth it if you have two separate github or bitbucket or whatever accounts and want to keep them separate.</p>
<h2 id="2-schedule-an-hour-before-work-method">2. Schedule an Hour Before Work Method</h2>
<p>Like suggested in the title, taking an hour before work can be a great way to start off the day. You get to work on something you want to right off the bat, and it can help you get into the “mood” of coding before the workday starts. The only issue you might run into is wanting to keep working on your project after your unofficial timer runs out. Pomodoro times are also very useful here!</p>
<h2 id="3-coffee-shop-weeknights-weekends">3. Coffee Shop Weeknights/Weekends</h2>
<p>Sometimes, I find it helps to work on personal projects with not just a different computer, but in a completely separate place. It’ll help you associate different contexts so that it doesn’t feel like you’re doing “work” coding just because you’re doing it from your office/workplace. I would go to a coffee shop several times a week solely to practice Rust code, and it was a great way to get into the groove and carve out time for myself to code for fun.</p>
<h2 id="4-calendarize">4. Calendarize</h2>
<p>For myself, I’m constantly working on projects&mdash;and one of my problems is starting or wanting to start new projects while I already have other projects in the works. While I can’t give the best advice <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/how-to-make-time-for-in-between-sized-projects-34c9ecd75146">on how to prioritize your projects</a>, I can say that once you have a prioritized list, you can try pinning it down to a calendar, splitting up say each week to focus on your different projects. And if there’s one project that you still want to work on after that week, perhaps that’s a project that you secretly care about more? This is what I figured out while working on my incremental empire management game, and realizing that I was low-key prioritizing it over other things.</p>
<p>So in summary, pursuing a hobby project can be fun, rewarding, and a great learning experience. If your passion for coding extends beyond your work (and you have the proper work-life balance elsewhere), then a passion project that lets you do what you love is always worth it. Just make sure you write a blog post once you’re done telling us what you learned!</p>
