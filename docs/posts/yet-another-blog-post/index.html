<p>Somewhere in the abyss of my older laptops, lie the carcasses of blog posts past. And among them, there’s a special type: the introductory post.</p>
<p>You know, that very first post that comes with each re-invention or reincarnation of any of the various blogs I’ve maintained over the past decade. Actually, it’s a terrifying thought: how often I’ve written or drafted a post that would serve as a Hello World to a new domain.
Domain. Let’s see, there were various discarded tumblrs in my early years, and then there was boltaway.com, and then there was [deadname].code, and a Github hosted site, and emmaramirez.me, only the latter surviving through the maelstrom of html and indecision.</p>
<p>Maybe my principle problem is that I become enthralled in code, and writing becomes a secondary concern. It doesn’t even matter how much boilerplate comes into the mix, I corrupt it into a full-blown project. (There’s enough shame in it all I force-deleted my old git history on this website’s repo).</p>
<p>Or I’m just bad at maintaining things (sorry petunias, sorry <code>clickopolis</code>, sorry bag of flour I attempted to raise as a child in high school).*</p>
<p>A third theory is that life and code both move faster than my ability to freeze them into a blog post, and the fatigue of both anchors me to mediocrity.</p>
<p>I’m sorry for wasting your time.</p>
<p>So, hello, again, I guess.</p>
<p><code>*potentionally didn&#39;t happen</code></p>
