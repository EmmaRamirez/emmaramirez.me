<p>Note: This could use a better title</p>

<p>Hi, I write and also I code. Sometimes, I am writing and coding, and it’s a creative maelstrom, where good ideas get sucked into a vortex, never to appear again; the void consumes more and more manifestations of my thoughts, leaving nothing but a couple words, a couple letters, scaters of syntax.</p>
<p>tl;dr check out some things I’m working on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/nuzlocke-generator">Nuzlocke Generator</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still working hard on this project, if you have any interest in Pokémon and nuzlocking, please check it out! I’ve been working on integrating downloading images, theme + component customizaiton, and supporting more variations in rulesets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/rust-and-webassembly-talk">Rust &amp; Webassembly Talk</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the repo for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-JS/events/xmkdvmyxlbtb/">talk I gave at BoulderJS</a>. I’ll just copypaste my abstract to give you an idea of the rundown:</p>
<p>Want to create powerful, high-performance web apps? Stuck at a bottleneck? Then this talk is for you!</p>
<p>Instead of a regular performance talk, we’ll focus here on abstracting key parts of your web app into Webassembly. By compiling Rust, a memory and thread-safe language, into Webassembly code, we can swap out bits of Javascript for a faster codebase. We’ll explore use cases and examples, with a focus on real-world problems that we can theoretically solve with wasm and Rust!</p>
<p>I’m working on polishing the repo so that the examples can be reused better, so check it out!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Okay, this is a bad name for repo, but here you can see me flounder around as I try to extend TSLint for some custom but kind of trivial rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/dom-to-image">dom-to-image</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a typescript rewrite of dom-to-image that improves performance, works with retina images, and includes bugfixes for Chrome &amp; Firefox.</p>
