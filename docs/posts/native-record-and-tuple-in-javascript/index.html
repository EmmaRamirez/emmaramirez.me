<p>⚠️ This is a stage 2 proposal and not yet a JS standard!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Javascript objects are generally mutable, and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/classes/09-immutability/">mutability has risks</a> that become more noticeable in large-scale web applications. Luckily, the JS community has myriad solutions to this problem, such as Immutable.js or native features such as <code>Object.freeze</code>.</p>
<p>So what's that got to do with the title? Well, <code>Record</code> &amp; <code>Tuple</code> are both new types that allow immutable native data structures in Javascript.</p>
<h2>The Record Type</h2>
<p>In Typescript, the <code>Record</code> type is defined as follows</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">type Record&lt;K extends string, T&gt; = {
    [P in K]: T;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and while they may seem very similar in shape, that's about all they have in common. Typescript <code>Record</code> is a utility mapped types, whereas Javascript <code>Record</code>s are a native type.</p>
<p>The Javascript definition of the <code>Record</code> type is nearly the same, with a key exception: <strong>it can only contain primitives</strong>. But just like the <code>Record</code> type defined above, it can be treated like an object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const record = #{
    dexNumber: 25,
    name: 'Pikachu',
    description: `Electric Mouse Pokemon
        Evolves into Raichu with a thunderstone`,
    types: #['electric']
}

// You can access keys like a regular JS object
console.log(record.dexNumber);

// You can use Object methods on the type
console.log(Object.keys(record));
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>#{ ... }</code> syntax is what defines a <code>Record</code> for us. What does that types declaration in our <code>Record</code> mean?</p>
<h2>The Tuple Type</h2>
<p>If <code>#{ ... }</code> defines a <code>Record</code>, it might not shock you that <code>#[ ... ]</code> defines the <code>Tuple</code> type. In the same way <code>Record</code> can be treated like a Javascript object, <code>Tuple</code>s can be treated like Arrays.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const tuple = #[0, 3];

// returns 3
console.log(tuple[1]);
</code></pre>
<h2>Putting it All Together</h2>
<p>The main benefit of these new native types is <em>native immutability</em>, which allows for more performant JS code* (Immutable's toJS and fromJS can be computationally expensive) and allowing for a cleaner mental model. By cleaner mental model, I mean both not having to think &quot;has this been mutated elsewhere?&quot; and equality that is similar to that of primitives.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">#{a: 1, b: 2} === #{a: 1, b: 2} // true!!

// compared to a standard object
{a: 1, b: 2} === {a: 1, b: 2}; // false :(
</code></pre>
<p>Let's take a look at a larger example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">// our record from earlier
const pokemon = {
    dexNumber: 25,
    name: 'Pikachu',
    description: `Electric Mouse Pokemon
        Evolves into Raichu with a thunderstone`,
    types: #['electric']
}

// spread the Record to create a new Record
const evolved = #{
    ...pokemon,
    name: 'Alolan Raichu',
    types: #['electric', 'psychic'],
}

// This results in a TypeError -- good
evolved.name = 'Kantonian Raichu';

// We can use Records as both map keys and map values
const pokedex = new Map();
map.set(evolved.name, evolved);

// Retrieve the types from our map and map the Tuple to strings
const displayTypes = map.get('Alolan Raichu').map(x =&gt; `${x} type`)).join(', ');

assert(displayTypes, 'electric type, psychic type');
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, there's a lot we can do with <code>Record</code>s and <code>Tuple</code>s at our disposal, without some of the issues we run into when using third-party libraries.</p>
<p>Overall I'm optimistic about this proposal advancing through tc39's stages, especially as it reduces the scope &amp; faults in design of previous native immutable type proposals.</p>
<p>* Many of these performance optimizations will happen based on JS engine choices, but the proposal specifically avoids some cases (i.e. a branch path) that would inhibit performance-tuning.</p>
