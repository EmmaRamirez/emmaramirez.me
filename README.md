## ❓ FAQ

**Why does it build at `docs`?**

This is a limitation of Github. Building to `gh-pages` isn't any better.

**How is it built?**

It's a hyper-simple component-based architecture. Components are written using HTML templates. There's a lot of room for growth. I eschewed using Gatsby or the like (which are all awesome by the way) because I wanted to waste my time / enjoy the simplicity.

**Why palm trees?**

I miss them so much. 🌴

## 🖊️ Contributing

I can't imagine anyone wanting to contribute to this, but on the off-chance contributions (especially grammar fixes on articles) are super welcome!

Issues can be used for anything, though ideas for writing would make you my favorite person.
